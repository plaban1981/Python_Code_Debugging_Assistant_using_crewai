Syntax error: The variable 'b' is not defined in the function add_numbers(a). \\n2. Logical error: The function add_numbers(a) is supposed to add two numbers, but it only takes one argument 'a' and tries to add it with an undefined variable 'b'. The function should be modified to either take two arguments or define the variable 'b' within the function. \\n\\nExample of corrected code:\\ndef add_numbers(a, b):\\n  return a + b\\n\\nAlternatively, if 'b' is supposed to be a constant, it should be defined within the function:\\ndef add_numbers(a):\\n  b = 5  # define 'b' as a constant\\n  return a + b\", pydantic=None, json_dict=None, agent='Manager', output_format=<OutputFormat.RAW: 'raw'>), TaskOutput(description='\\n    Your task is to analyze and fix Python code based on the analyzer agent\\'s findings.\\n    You must return your response in valid JSON format exactly matching this structure:\\n    {\\n        \"error\": \"<error description or \\'None\\'>\",\\n        \"fix\": \"<fix explanation or \\'None\\'>\",\\n        \"rectifiled_code\": \"<corrected code>\"\\n    }\\n    \\n    Important:\\n    1.
